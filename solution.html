        <h3>Solutions</h3>

        <p>
            While many of the powerful giant cable companies in the United States may be trying to hold onto their regional monopolies, some communities have tackled this problem and have had successful results.<br><br>

            As TBO points out, local authorities have a lot of power in cases where cable companies have monopolies. They say that "The problems in the cable market are endemic and stem from local government cronyism. Consumers who want to see options for cable and Internet service should not turn their anger at Comcast’s or Time Warner’s corporate offices, but rather at their own city hall" (<a href="http://tbo.com/list/news-opinion-commentary/dont-blame-comcast-and-time-warner-for-cable-monopolies-20140305/
">TBO.com</a>). TBO emphasizes that with their regulations and laws, local governments can either promote or stifle competition between cable companies. Because of this power, TBO recommends that when looking for change, people should petition their local government or "the city hall."<br><br>
            The White House agrees with TBO in the fact that local governments can be very influential and critical to promoting competition. They say, "Local governments also have a critical role to play. In markets where private competition is anemic, whether because of regulatory barriers to entry or the high fixed costs of infrastructure investment, town and cities can build their own middle-mile networks and offer competitive access to the private sector" (<a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/docs/community-based_broadband_report_by_executive_office_of_the_president.pdf">WhiteHouse.gov</a>). The White House goes on to give specific advice about what the local city governments can do to help encourage competition and better Internet service in their area. They advise that "Where the market does not generate the optimal level of competition or investment, the public sector can step in to make investments, encourage competition and provide choice to consumers" (<a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/docs/community-based_broadband_report_by_executive_office_of_the_president.pdf">WhiteHouse.gov</a>). This public investment promotes competition and has had a positive economic impact in cities like Chattanooga, TN and Wilson, NC and also benefits the citizens there who now recieve better Internet service.<br><br>

            Hopefully, you've noticed from reading on this website that there is a big problem in the United States with cable companies and their high prices and poor service in many areas beacuse they hold regional monopolies and give consumers little choice. If your community is like this, there are many things you can do to try to help solve the problem. As many sources including the White House point out, a good place to start solving this problem on a local level can be petitioning local authorities for public investment in Internet infrastructure.<br><br>
            <h3>A sample letter to a local leader</h3>
        <center>
<a href="http://www.clker.com/cliparts/c/d/9/8/11949844932066876509lettera_architetto_franc_01.svg.thumb.png"><img src='http://www.clker.com/cliparts/c/d/9/8/11949844932066876509lettera_architetto_franc_01.svg.thumb.png' alt='Letter Envelope clip art'/></a></center><br>
        Here's an outline for a letter or email you could send to a local leader to raise awareness about this issue.
            <blockquote>
                Dear _____,<br><br>
                I've noticed that like in many communities in the United States, lack of competition between Internet service providers has resulted in poorer Internet service for higher costs in our area. Since many have little choice for Internet providers at higher speeds, our Internet providers have no incentive to lower prices or improve service because they know that customers in our area don't have many options.<br><br>
                I urge you to look more into this issue, and <a href="https://nicolaschan.com/cable">nicolaschan.com/cable</a> has lots of information. I think our community should seriously consider investing in improving the Internet infrastructure in the area and possibly look into developing municipal broadband.<br><br>
                Sincerely,<br>
                ____________
