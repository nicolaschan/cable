            The United States lags behind other developed countries when it comes to quality of Internet service and costs. Lack of competition between Internet providers negatively impacts consumers by driving prices up and resulting worse service.<br>

            In the United States, customers get worse service for higher prices than in other countries because in many places there is little choice between companies for consumers. The New Yorker reports that "we pay far more for broadband Internet access, cable television, and home phone lines than people in many other advanced countries, even though the services we get aren’t any better" (<a href="http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/we-need-real-competition-not-a-cable-internet-monopoly
">The New Yorker</a>).<br><br>
            It's not just higher prices that hurt consumers, but also the poor service. As Rob Beschizza recounts in his article about his experience dealing with Comcast, "if I were a commuter, I’d have lost three days of work (so far) hanging around waiting for the cable guy" (<a href="http://www.wired.com/2007/08/first-hand-expe/">Wired</a>). If there had been more competition in his area, Beschizza could have simply switched from Comcast to a different provider, but this is not the case because like in many places in the United States, certain cable companies have a local monopoly. With access to the Internet being <i>vital</i> for so many people, having to deal with your regional cable company is not avoidable and not having the option to switch to a different provider results in poorer service and higher prices because companies don't have to compete.
            <br><br>
            As the Executive Office of the President reports, "Without strong competition, providers can (and do) raise prices, delay investments, and provide sub-par quality of service. When faced with limited or nonexistent alternatives, consumers lack negotiating power and are forced to rely on whatever options are available" (<a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/docs/community-based_broadband_report_by_executive_office_of_the_president.pdf">WhiteHouse.gov</a>). This is exactly why consumers such as Beschizza have such a difficult time with cable companies. The consumers have no choice but to go with what the service providers offer, even if that service is extremely poor. Without competition, cable providers have no incentive to innovate or improve their service and this will continue to harm consumers.
        <br><br>
        But, you may ask, if all this is true, then how did it get so bad?
        </p>
        <h3><a class="anchor" href="#welcome-to-github-pages" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Why is there such little competition in the cable industry?</h3>
        <p>
            There are many possible causes for this problem and all may be true to some extent.<br><br>
<center><a href="http://www.clker.com/cliparts/e/e/2/5/11949858391332901534government_icon_-_symbo_01.svg.thumb.png"><img src='http://www.clker.com/cliparts/e/e/2/5/11949858391332901534government_icon_-_symbo_01.svg.thumb.png' alt='Government Icon - Symbol clip art'/></a></center><br>

            Some blame government regulations that stifle competition in favor of the cable companies that have already been established. TBO.com reports that "Cable companies may hold local monopolies, but local governments and public utility commissions dictate this lack of competition through sweetheart deals designed to line the pockets of the city at the consumer’s expense" (<a href="http://tbo.com/list/news-opinion-commentary/dont-blame-comcast-and-time-warner-for-cable-monopolies-20140305/">TBO.com</a>). TBO claims that ultimately it is local governments and public utility commissions that have the power to either promote or stifle competition, so the responsibility is on them to make the changes. While this may be part of the truth, others have different explanations.<br><br>

            Gizmodo reports that the cable industry is a "natural monopoly" which "occurs when it's so expensive to enter a market that it doesn't make sense for a competitors to come in" (<a href="http://gizmodo.com/5830956/why-the-government-wont-protect-you-from-getting-screwed-by-your-cable-company">Gizmodo</a>). Things like laying cable are expensive for small businesses to invest in which makes it so only large cable companies have a chance.<br><br>

            Others blame the cable companies themselves for stifling competition. Public Integrity reports that cable companies "have spent millions of dollars to lobby state legislatures, influence state elections and buy research to try to stop the spread of public Internet services that often offer faster speeds at cheaper rates" (<a href="http://www.publicintegrity.org/2014/08/28/15404/how-big-telecom-smothers-city-run-broadband">Public Integrity</a>). Motivated by their profits, these cable companies don't want to see other comepetition emerging in their areas because it would impact how much money they make. Competition would force these cable companies to improve their service and/or lower prices in order to keep customers from switching away, two things these companies don't want to do. FT.com reports that these companies have even worked with each other to maximize profits by dividing the country. FT says that "In 1997 the large operators reordered the map into a convenient tartan, with each controlling large contiguous territories. Leo Hindery, then chief executive of a cable company that was later absorbed by Comcast, called it the industry’s 'summer of love'. These giants have never encroached on each other’s turf" (<a href="http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/5645e304-97f5-11e3-8c0e-00144feab7de.html">FT.com</a>). The actions these cable companies have taken to stifle competition include influencing the laws through lobbying and dividing the country into regions for each company to minimize competition.
            <br><br>
            The truth in this issue is likely due to a combination of government regulations, the fact that it is difficult for competition to emerge in this industry, and also actions the cable companies themselves have taken. Despite these problems, there are numerous examples of communities effectively introducing competition that has been shown to work in the past. <a href="solution.html">Learn more about solutions &#8594;</a>
